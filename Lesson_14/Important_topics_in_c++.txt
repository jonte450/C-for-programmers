OOP
What do the letters in OOP signify?

Object-oriented programming


Classes

What is a class?

Class is a user defined data type

What is an object?

instance of a Class


What are the 5 types of inheritance in C++?

Single Inheritance 
Multiple Inheritance 
Hierarchical Inheritance 
Multilevel Inheritance 
Hybrid Inheritance

What are the three access class specifiers in C++?

public
private
protected


What is encapsulation?

Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.



What is data abstraction?

Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.


What is inheritance?

Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class


What is an advantage of inline functions?

reduce the execution time


What makes a class an abstract class?

A pure virtual function


What will be the value of i and j after the following code is executed?

int i = 10;
int j = i++;

i= 11,j=10

How many times will this loop execute?

     unsigned char half_limit = 150;

     for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 2 * half_limit; ++i)
     {
         // do something;
     }

Infinite because of unsigned char has value only to 255.

This question comes from an excellent website:

C++ Essential Interview Questions

Virtual Methods
What is the output of this code?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base {
    virtual void method() {std::cout << "from Base" << std::endl;}
public:
    virtual ~Base() {method();}
    void baseMethod() {method();}
};
class A : public Base {
    void method() {std::cout << "from A" << std::endl;}
public:
    ~A() {method();}
};
int main(void) {
    Base* base = new A;
    base->baseMethod();
    delete base
}

from A from A from Base

Don't know why????

Virtual Functions
What is a virtual function?

A virtual function a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.


Static Variables
What is the output of this code?

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int returnValue()
{
    static int i = 0;
    i++;
    return i;
}

int main()
{
    cout<<"\ni = "<<returnValue();
    cout<<"\ni = "<<returnValue();
    cout<<"\ni = "<<returnValue();
    return 0;
}

1
2
3
Because static variables only be assigned one time and then keeps its value.

Static Variable Definition
What is a static variable?

Static variables when used inside function are initialized only once, and then they hold there value even through function calls.


Define a static member variable

What is a static member variable?

A static member is shared by all objects of the class.

//Write a C++ function to swap two integers without
//using a temp variable. 

//Hint: think about pointers

//Write a C++ function to swap two integers without
//using a temp variable. 

//Hint: think about pointers



//Write a C++ function to swap two integers without
//using a temp variable. 

//Hint: think about pointers

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void swap(int *x, int *y)
{
     if(x == y)
         return;
     *x = *x + *y;
     *y = *x - *y;
     *x = *x - *y;
}

int main()
{
     int x = 15;
     int y = 20;
     cout<<"\nBefore swap x = "<<x<<" y = "<<y;
     swap(&x,&y);
     cout<<"\nAfter swap x = "<<x<<" y = "<<y;
     return 0;
}
